#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rules for library version information:
#
#  1. Start with version information of `0:0:0' for each libtool library.
#  2. Update the version information only immediately before a public release of
#     your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee
#     that the current interface number gets larger faster.
#  3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then
#     increment revision (`c:r:a' becomes `c:r+1:a').
#  4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last update,
#     increment current, and set revision to 0.
#  5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then increment
#     age.
#  6. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then set age
#     to 0.

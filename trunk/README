libtimefilter README
====================

Introduction
------------

libtimefilter is a C library for accurate time stamping from a real-time
context. It is heavily based on Fons Adriaensen's work about "Using a DLL
to filter time" (http://www.kokkinizita.net/papers/usingdll.pdf).

Its primary target is audio applications, and especially JACK based ones,
but chances are that it may also be useful in other kinds of software.

It also provides some tools to mesure the raw and corrected accuracy of your
system and hardware.

Requirements
------------

- JACK >= 0.109
- octave >= 3

Documentation
-------------

There isn't much doc for now. See src/timefilter.h for the API.

Compilation
-----------

Building libtimefilter with waf::

  $ ./waf configure
  $ ./waf build

Measuring
---------

You can run all the measuring tools at once with::

  $ ./measure

Then generate graphs into measures/ using::

  $ ./graph

Installation
------------

If you want to install libtimefilter into a specific location then check the 
--prefix option of the waf configure task. Otherwise simply type::
